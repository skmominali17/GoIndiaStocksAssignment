# README.md for Next.js Application

## Introduction

This README provides instructions on how to run the Next.js application on your local machine. Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skmominali17/GoIndiaStocksAssignment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd goindiastocks
   ```


3. **Install dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the development server**

   Run the following command to start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the server in development mode. You should see output indicating that the server is running, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Access the application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your Next.js application running.

This will serve your application on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is already in use).
